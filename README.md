### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS variables
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This profile card was used to help me practice more of my layout skills with HTML and CSS. I practiced how to use divs within the HTML so that I could them create the layout properly with CSS.

### Continued development

I need to do some more research and some more practice on working with SVGs for the background image. I had a difficult time making the background image responsive for all screen sizes as the positioning of the images weren't aligning properly on the screen.

### Useful resources

- [CSS FlexBox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped refresh me on some of the properties of CSS FlexBox so that I could create some elements within the card.
